# Configuration File Protection

## Issue Resolution

The `config.php` file was previously tracked in the repository, which meant that during FTP updates, the configured version would be overwritten with the placeholder version from the repository.

**Problem**: `config.php est toujours présent sur le repos, lors d'une mise à jour par ftp la config sera écrasé`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed config.php from Git Tracking
- The `config.php` file has been removed from git tracking using `git rm --cached config/config.php`
- It is already properly excluded in `.gitignore` under `config/config.php`
- ✅ **Result**: Repository no longer contains the configuration file

### 2. Installation Process
- The `config.php` file is now only generated during installation via `install.php`
- The installation process creates the file from `config/config.template.php`
- An `.installed` marker file is created to indicate successful installation
- ✅ **Result**: Each site has its own unique configuration

### 3. Update Protection Mechanisms

#### Automatic Redirection
- `index.php` automatically redirects to `install.php` if `config.php` doesn't exist
- This ensures the system cannot run without proper configuration
- ✅ **Result**: Graceful handling of missing configuration

#### Update Process Protection
Multiple layers of protection during system updates:

1. **Critical Directories Protection**
   ```php
   $CRITICAL_DIRECTORIES = ['config', 'uploads', 'logs', 'backups'];
   ```
   - The entire `config/` directory is protected during updates
   - Other critical directories: `uploads/`, `logs/`, `backups/`

2. **Specific File Exclusion**
   ```php
   $UPDATE_EXCLUDE_FILES = ['config.php', '.htaccess', '.ovhconfig'];
   ```
   - `config.php` is specifically excluded from being overwritten
   - Other protected files: `.htaccess`, `.ovhconfig`

3. **ConfigProtector Class**
   - New helper class to verify configuration protection
   - Validates that config files are properly protected
   - Integrated into the update process for additional safety
   - Methods: `verifyConfigProtection()` and `isProtectedFile()`

### 4. Benefits

- **FTP Update Safety**: config.php will never be overwritten during FTP updates
- **Git Repository Cleanliness**: No sensitive configuration data in the repository
- **Installation Integrity**: System properly handles missing configuration
- **Update Process Safety**: Multiple protection layers during automated updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing installations continue to work normally

### 5. Testing Results

The protection mechanisms have been comprehensively tested:

✅ config.php is not tracked by git  
✅ config.php is properly excluded in .gitignore  
✅ index.php redirects to installation when config is missing  
✅ Update process properly protects configuration files  
✅ ConfigProtector class provides additional verification  
✅ FTP update simulation confirms complete protection  

### 6. Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `bo/update.php`: Enhanced protection mechanisms and ConfigProtector class
- `config/config.php`: Removed from repository (deleted from git tracking)

**Files Added:**
- `CONFIG_PROTECTION.md`: This documentation file

**Protection Verification:**
All protection tests pass successfully, confirming that the issue is fully resolved.

**Resolution Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** 

The config.php file is now fully protected from being overwritten during FTP updates while maintaining all system functionality.
